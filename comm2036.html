        <!--
        <h1> Introduction of the movie </h1>
        -->
        <p> This is a story about the secret life of toys, who come alive whenever humans are not around. Woody, a toy cowboy (voiced by Hanks), has long been Andy Davis's favorite toy. 
            When Andy gets a flashy new astronaut called Buzz Lightyear (Allen) for his birthday, Woody feels neglected and jealous. Buzz is a not-very-bright jock type, who really thinks 
            he is a superhero astronaut marooned on an alien planet. When he falls out a window, the other toys accuse Woody of trying to kill him. But there are real threats in store: the 
            mean kid next door tears apart toys and puts them back together in creepy combinations, and when Andy's family decides to move, Woody and Buzz get left at a gas station and have
            to figure out how to reunite with their friends, which include green plastic soldiers, Tinkertoys, and Etch-a-Sketch, Mr. Potatohead (Rickles), Slinky Dog (Varney), Rex the cowardly
            Tyrannosaurus (Shawn), and others. This 1995 hit was the first fully computer-generated feature film, and a huge success in every sense of the word.
